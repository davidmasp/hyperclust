# hyperClust

**WIP WARNING**

hyperClust is a software for detection of somatic local hyper-mutation.
In brief, mutations that are located closer than expected to their
nearest neighbor (closest adjacent mutation) are considered clusters
of mutagenesis. These clusters can have different characteristics and
be generated from a sort of different mutational processes.

## Installation

### Requirements

hyperClust is built with [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) so an Unix system
plus a nextflow installation
is required, other required software can be listed here, however, installation
of the generated conda environtment by nextflow should be sufficient.
