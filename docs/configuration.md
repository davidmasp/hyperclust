# hyperclust: Configuration

## Configuration directory

The main parameters to configure the pipeline are found in [conf](../conf).

The file is structured in a main [`nextflow.config`](../nextflow.config)
file which handles general parameters. The configuration profiles are
availble in the [configuration directory](../conf).

In the `nextflow.config` file the profiles are defined for each case.
Modify this file to include your HPC configuration.
